        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.

            Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.[1]
            
            The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature, and in certain languages the sport is named by reference to this feature (e.g., German Federball, literally feather-ball).
            
            The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles;[2] mixed doubles was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements involving much greater flexibility in the wrist than some other racquet sports.[3]

            Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia,[a] but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the expatriate officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".)[4] Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire,[5] but why or when remains unclear.[citation needed] As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore – A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived.[6] An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".[7]

            The game originally developed in India among the British expatriates,[8] where it was very popular by the 1870s.[6] Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s[9] and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

            Early on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of Poona (Pune),[8][10] where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873.[6][7][b] By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in Folkestone. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best.[4] The shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with lead.[4] Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.[4]

            The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath Badminton Club drew up revised regulations.[5] In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules.[6] The Badminton Association of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called "Dunbar"[c] in Portsmouth on 13 September.[12] The BAE started the first badminton competition, the All England Open Badminton Championships for gentlemen's doubles, ladies' doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899.[5] Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an England–Ireland championship match appeared in 1904.[5]

           <div class="list">
        <ol>
            <li>You would be amazed to know that badminton can be played in both singles and doubles. In the single rally match, two players will be there to play with each other, whereas in the double rally match, you can pair up with your friend like the set of cards.</li>
            <li>Yeah, just like cricket, even in badminton, the toss is conducted to allow a fair and create an ethical playing environment. A toss is made to derive a conclusion for the team batting first. Either you are playing professional matches like tournaments and the Olympics or informal matches with your family. A toss is necessary to carry on the game smoothly with no hindrances. The first serve is also passed to the team that won in the previous match.</li>
            <li>If you make the birdie hit on the opponent's surface or the lines, congratulations! The point is yours. You also have the chance to win when your opponent hits the birdie on the net if the birdie goes out of the boundary. Even if the player strikes the birdie twice, even there, you have the chance to win.</li>
            <li>In badminton, you cannot choose any side by yourself randomly as you wish, and this is one of the basic rules. When your server scores even numbers at the beginning of the game, you should be at the right service court and vice versa.</li>
            <li>This is the most vital part of the game. You should look at your feet and your hands, which should not touch the white line, even your rackets shouldn't touch the white line. Therefore, play it and be very careful while playing badminton.</li>
            <li>Always be careful of your actions while playing during the game. Your actions have a high influence on your availability in the game. If you miss the rules, there is a chance that you will get knocked out of the game.

                Bullying, not abiding by the rules, etc, can push you out of the game and be considered out.</li>
